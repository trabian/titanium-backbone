## titanium-backbone

Titanium-backbone is a framework for building native iOS and Android
apps using Titanium and Backbone.

### Current status

This project is in very early stages of extraction from a production
[mobile banking
application](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sf-fire-credit-union-mobile/id492113880?mt=8),
but the ideas and patterns extracted have worked very well within this
large app. We're taking the time to refactor as we extract so it should
be even cleaner.

We have a Google Group at http://groups.google.com/group/titanium-backbone if you'd like to participate.

### Installation

#### Install Titanium SDK

Visit the [Titanium download page](http://www.appcelerator.com/products/download/) and follow the instructions from there to download Titanium Studio (and the Titanium SDK), or clone the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile). Prior to running an app generated by titanium-backbone you'll need to set the TITANIUM_DIR environment variable to point to your install of the SDK. For example:

```console
$ export TITANIUM_DIR=~/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.0.1.GA2
```

#### Clone the project to your development machine:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:trabian/titanium-backbone.git
$ cd titanium-backbone
```

#### Install package dependencies

```console
$ npm install
```

#### Run the app generator to create a new mobile app

```console
$ ./bin/tb new [app name]
# Run ./bin/tb new --help for instructions
```

_Optional:_ Install and run the app generator globally by running:

```console
$ npm install -g
$ tb new --help
```
